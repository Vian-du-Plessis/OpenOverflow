### Project Description

As a team we were expected to build a full MERN stack application similar to Stack Overflow which would be used for the next generation of Open Window Development students. This application will allow students to post development based questions and answers, vote for the best solutions and earn points which will be benificial to their profile through badges, trophies and status.  

### Built With
* [SASS](https://sass-lang.com/)
* [React](https://reactjs.org/)

### User Profile Management
The users are able to login, register, authenticate, validate, logout and delete their accounts. User data will be protected by using Bcrypt or a similar level of password hashing and all users must have a valid Open Window email adress to register and an avatar must be selected.

### User Profile and Achievements
Each user has a profile which shows thier past questions, answers and their score. Based on the upvotes and downvotes, users accure and lose their points.Badges, trophies and status is based on the acuured points each user achieves.

### Admin Rights
The user permission allows admins to monitor questions and answers, and allows them to delete any irrelevant qestions or answers.

### User Security and Registration
As previously explained all passwords are hashed to comply with safety requirements and email authentication and password resets are also made available to the ussers.

### Questions
The user is able to post questions which contain a text box, image upload for the screenshots, and a block for code snippets. A voting system is put in place where other users are able to vote the quality of the question asked. In order to filter through the questions they must consist of a title, description and tags allowing the top rated questions to be placed at the top of the questions page.

### Answers
The user is able to post answers which also contains a text box, image upload for any screenshots, and a block for code snippets. A voting system is put in place in order for other users to vote on the quality of the answers

### Articles
Part of signing up, the user will have to choose certain tags to follow which they might be interested in. The recommended articles will be listed in the articles page based on the tags the user has selected. Through this the users are able to filter through all the tags, follow any new tags which they find interesting and "like" any of the tags they deemed helpful or insightful.

### Search and Results
The users are able to filter through and search for questions and the results are displayed on the results page.

<!-- CONCEPT PROCESS -->
<!-- Briefly explain your concept ideation process -->
<!-- here you will add things like wireframing, data structure planning, anything that shows your process. You need to include images-->
## Concept Process

The `Conceptual Process` is the set of actions, activities and research that was done when starting this project. <br>
For this application, I wanted to create something as close to a real ecommerce website as I possibly could while considering the time constraint that was set in place, I wanted to create something that would be attractive to the "users". Fika clothing was approached in more of a website, taking inspiration from websites such as the official VANS website and Takealot.  
<br> 
Throughout the conceptual process of this application , I had started taking more consideration of components and how the application should be structured, this would make it easier for myself to create reusable component and for future developers to uderstand how the project is structured. This would make the entire process smoother, I had also learned about MONGODB Atlas, a NoSQL database that would be used alongside NODE and Express. 


### Ideation

### Wireframes
As part of the ideation process, Figma helped the wireframing process as it was a crucial part to determining all the important information for the project and to ensure that everything is displayed in a creative yet functional manner.

<!-- DEVELOPMENT PROCESS -->
## Development Process

The `Development Process` is the technical implementations and functionality done in the frontend and backend of the application.

### Implementation Process
<!-- stipulate all of the functionality you included in the project -->
<!-- This is your time to shine, explain the technical nuances of your project, how did you achieve the final outcome!-->

* Better management of components, giving each component a folder that will hold the stylesheet along with the component. 
* Working with useContext in order to improve state management throughout the entire project, making less code do more. 
* Working searchbar in the project that will return the correct data
* SASS was implemented in order to make styling more efficient and easier to understand, this could also assist with consistency of colours throughout the project.
* AWS buckets implemented for images, thus making the program run faster due to less memory taken up in the actual project. 
* Filters and sorting implemented to aid users in the search for shoes. 
* Colours loaded dynamically through the database along with the sizes 
* Reviews section where users can leave a review and view all the other reviews 
* Going back a page implemented through useNavigate(-1)
* orders are tracked and dates are dynamically populated for dispatch 

#### Highlights
<!-- stipulated the highlight you experienced with the project -->
* Over the course of this project, one of the main highlights was the use of REACT, I have learned a lot about React recently and this was a way of testing it and really starting to make React work, this has been an exciting project in that regard and I will continue to learn more about REact so that I am able to use the full power of it. 
* Using NodeJS and Express has been extremly exciting, Mongo has also been a highlight and a better experience than an SQL database. The use of Javascript as a backend language has been fantastic. 
* I really enjoyed the complexity of this project, although I feel the project can be pushed further, I have done a lot and I am proud of the project as a whole. This project has definetly been my favorite project that I've done and I hope to improve it. 

#### Challenges
<!-- stipulated the challenges you faced with the project and why you think you faced it or how you think you'll solve it (if not solved) -->
* One of my largest challenges in this project was considering how all the required fields were going to be laid out, this was more of a front end issue and I do thinnk I can improve on this aspect.  
* The creation of my database has been a major struggle, I think I tried to make it more complex, but it has been a good struggle and I have definetly learned a lot about how to better structure things in the future 
* One of my BIGGEST issues in this project lays within my cart, unfortunately the way I have set it up, it can only handle one variation at a time, this is a problem that I am actively investigating and will fix. 

#### Above And Beyond

What aspects of this final build contribute to the `Above And Beyond` Component of your brief?
<!-- what did you learn outside of the classroom and implement into your project-->
* Implementation of reviews, this was fairly ease considering my DB structure, but it worked out for the best. 
* AWS buckets
* AWS buckets, this was used for image storage as opposed to using multer and the local machine. This was exciting because I dont think other students were able to achieve this.

* Context state management
* Context state management was implemented into the project in order to make code easier to read and make data easier to update, this was quite challenging and I dont fully understand Context as of yet, but I do have a good grasp on it and Im looking forward to learning more about it so that I can use something like REDUX or GraphQL 
* SASS
* Sass was used as a means to make Css more readable due to its structure. SCSS allows for external files to be linked. This was used to create more consistency in the front end of the application with the use of variables. The variables would allow me to predefine aspects such as fonts and colours to be re-used. Variables would also avoid aspects of too much repetition and making the code look un neat. 

### Future Implementation
<!-- stipulate functionality and improvements that can be implemented in the future. -->
* IN future I would like to do more server side rendering and focus on the backend.
 
* A fututre implementation is making the project a more accurate ecommerce website, this would make it more appealing.
